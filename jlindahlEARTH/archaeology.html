                <h3>The Mystery Behind Artifact Theft</h3>
                <h4>By: Linda Weaver Clarke</h4>
                <p>Ancient American artifacts are being sold to the highest bidder. When an ancient ruin is discovered, it doesn’t take long for thieves to find out about it. Archaeological thievery is becoming more and more of a problem every year but Utah’s vandalism is the worst in the country. Theft at the Four Corners area of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona is still a big problem. The damage to these sites is estimated at almost $42,000 in two year’s time. An ancient funeral pit can be sold for as high as $60,000 on the black market, not to mention pottery, baskets, and pendants found by looters.</p>
                <p>An article in the Associated Press said, "Two dozen people were indicted Wednesday after a sweeping undercover investigation into ancient artifacts stolen from public and tribal lands in the Four Corners area." (Associated Press, Mike Stark, June 11, 2009)</p>
                <p>
                    There were around 300 federal agents that were involved in the arrest of both men and women from ages twenty-seven to seventy-eight. They were all part of an underground network. In fact, archaeological theft has gone corporate. They even pay rent on private property in order to dig without being caught. Unfortunately there is no law to prevent digging on private property.
                </p>
                <p>I read an article in the Las Vegas Sun Newspaper about a couple men who were loading some artifacts in the trunk of their car. A ranger saw what they were doing and questioned them, not realizing he had accidentally stumbled upon the largest operation around. The article said they recovered more than 11,100 relics.</p>
                <p>
                    Did you know that people are actually selling shards and arrowheads on websites? The Anasazi culture is being sold to the highest bidder. Is there anything that can be done to protect America’s past?
                </p>
                <p>This subject was so intriguing to me that I sat down and began writing. My new mystery series surrounds the theft of artifacts. In Anasazi Intrigue, we find that the mystery of the Anasazi Indians boggles the minds of many archaeologists. Ancient dwellings, petroglyphs, and pottery are part of Anasazi history. When an ancient ruin is discovered, it doesn’t take long for thieves to take it apart. Did you know that looting is only second to selling illegal drugs? While writing Mayan Intrigue, I found that artifact thievery in Mexico has been taken over by drug dealers from Columbia. This amazed me! In other words, since organized crime has taken over, there is also an increase of violence. Can anything be done to save Ancient American history? You bet! The only way is for no one to buy it.</p>

                <h3>There's more to Malia Than Meets the Eye!</h3>
                <h4>By: Allison-jane Draper</h4>
                <p>
                    Malia has been Crete's number one party resort since the late eighties. Its reputation was, and still is, based on British 18-30s on package deals in search of sea, sand and sunshine, plus very cheap drinks and all night discos. The old village of Malia is located on the main road that connects Heraklion and Agios Nikolaos, going above but parallel to the sea. From here, there are smaller side roads leading down to the last beachside developments, including mid-range hotels, self catering apartments and rooms for rent, restaurants, bars and clubs. The long stretch of coast consists of a number of sandy beaches with the season's bars and water sports facilities. Malia Port, a bit east of downtown, is filled with excursion boats offering one-day cruises. Despite Malia's reputation for drunken young Brits, there is still a more cosmopolitan side to the resort, with plenty of restaurants and bars that are well preserved and aimed at a more sophisticated clientele.
                </p>
                <p>Malia grew up along a 2 km stretch of coastline punctuated by a series of sandy beaches. The larger beaches have snack bars, beach, beach chairs and umbrellas for rent, and water sports facilities including banana boats, donut rings, jet skiing, water skiing and bungee jumping. Beaches are generally quieter tomorrow as its late-night revellers are rarely out of bed before noon. Many of the hotels have small outdoor pools, a surprising number of visitors seem to prefer the sea.</p>
                <p>Sleeping off the effects of the night before seems to take a reasonable share of the many visitors time, but those who feel up to it may appreciate a trip to the Minoan palace of Malia, a 4,000 years old archaeological site similar to the better known palace of Minoan Knossos, near Heraklion. If you are in need of pampering just a 10-minute drive west of Malia is the Star Beach Water Park is an exclusive spa centre offers massage, hydro massage, aromatherapy, seaweed therapy, body wraps, sauna, and facials.</p>
                <p>Malia beaches are great for kids, although some people may find the place too noisy and chaotic for the children. There are several fantastic water parks nearby. A 10-minute drive west of Malia is Star Beach Water Park, complete with swimming pools, water slides, a lazy river, bars, music with guest DJs and party foam, a large beach that offers water skiing, parasailing and scuba diving, plus a spa centre.</p>
